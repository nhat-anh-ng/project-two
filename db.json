Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water.\nReturning to the food processor, add in the sun-dried tomato, and walnuts. Blend until smooth, but some small chunks can remain, if desired.\nIn the last two minutes of the pasta cooking, add the peas to the cooking water. When the pasta is al dente, drain. Then return the drained pasta to the pot. Add the cooked zucchini and blended red bell pepper mixture to the pot. Toss everything to coat.\nOne heated through, serve while hot. Garnish if desired, and enjoy!",

      "preparation": "Prepare and have at-the-ready your desired toppings: the pistachios, dried raspberries, coconut flakes, hemp seeds, candied pineapple, and rose petals. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.\nFill a saucepan one-quarter full with water, and bring to a gentle boil. Place a large heat-safe bowl on top of the pan and add the chocolate. The heat from the bowl will melt the chocolate. Stir throughout.\nOnce melted, remove the bowl from the stove (be careful as the bowl will be hot). Pour the melted chocolate onto the baking tray.\nUse the back of a rubber spatula to spread the chocolate out into a thin layer, about ½ cm thick.\nSprinkle over top all of the toppings. Then use the back of a spoon to gently press down the pieces into the chocolate. Place the chocolate bark in the fridge for at least 1 hour to harden.\nOnce solid, let slightly soften at room temperature for a minute before cutting to avoid it snapping in other places. Cut into your desired shapes and sizes. Enjoy!",
